# Creating a new table for Spotify database

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,

liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

# Next, I inserted the Spotify data .csv file into the table.

# Then, I answered the questions I came up below with by viewing the data and using SQL.

-- # 1. Which artist was listened to the most (in terms of number of songs)?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(artist_name) desc
LIMIT 1;

-- # 2. What are the top 5 artists according to average popularity of their songs?
SELECT artist_name, (SUM(popularity)/COUNT(artist_name)) AS avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(popularity) desc
LIMIT 5;
